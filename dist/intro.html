          This site was born out of the need to pay a fitting tribute to a remarkable man and an exceptional driver.
          Perhaps he isn't as widely known and appreciated as he rightfully should be, considering all that he gave and
          could have given had fate not intervened.
        </p>
        <p>In 1984, Michele Alboreto was chosen by Enzo Ferrari himself. Prior to that, the last Italian
          F1 driver to steer a Ferrari was Arturo Merzario in 1973</p>
        <p> Enzo Ferrari, the head of the Ferrari team, typically did not favor Italian drivers for his cars. However,
          an exception was made for Michele due to his personal qualities and driving prowess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michele spent five years at Ferrari, from 1984 to 1988, and came close to clinching the world champion title
          in 1985. The championship slipped from his grasp not due to his own errors, but due to a drop in the car's
          reliability during the final races. He was the last Italian driver to genuinely contend for the F1 World
          Champion title, and he remains the last Italian to win a Grand Prix while driving for Ferrari

        <p>It's likely that there won't be others quite like him...</p>

        with a beautiful style: qualities that remind me of Wolfgang von
        Trips, to which Alboreto also resembles a polite and serious trait. I
        have argued that it is among the top six in Formula 1 and that with a
        competitive car it will certainly not waste the chance to become a
        champion"<br /><span>(Enzo Ferrari)</span>
