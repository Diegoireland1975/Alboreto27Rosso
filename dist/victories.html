        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The 1982 Caesars Palace Grand Prix was the sixteenth and final race of the 1982 FIA Formula One World
          Championship, and the second and last F1 race to be held in Las Vegas.
          The 75-lap race was won by Michele Alboreto, driving a Tyrrell-Ford.John Watson finished second in a
          McLaren-Ford, with Eddie Cheever third in a Ligier-Matra. Keke Rosberg finished fifth in his Williams-Ford to
          secure the Drivers' Championship, with Ferrari taking the Constructors' Championship despite neither car
          finishing in the top six.
          This was the last F1 race for 1978 World Champion Mario Andretti.<br></p>
        <h3>The race</h3>
        <p>
          At the green light for the race on Saturday, Prost led from the pole, followed by teammate Arnoux. Cheever,
          from the fourth spot on the grid, was determined to get around the outside of Alboreto on the first
          left-hander. They touched wheels, but both continued with Alboreto still in front, Cheever's Ligier sporting a
          vibrating front wheel and the Tyrrell of Alboreto bearing a tire mark on the right sidepod.
          For the first ten laps, the Renaults steadily pulled away from Alboreto, with Arnoux now leading Prost. The
          Tyrrell began to match Arnoux's times, however, and then to close on him, as Prost took back the lead on lap
          15. Speculation of a problem with Arnoux's car proved true, as the Renault was faltering, and he retired on
          lap 21.
          Watson, meanwhile, had dropped to twelfth in the opening laps, but passed Piquet on lap 12, then Rosberg,
          Andretti and Cheever on successive laps, eventually reaching third place, with a thirty-second gap to the two
          leaders. However, when Andretti, hoping to help clinch the Constructors' title for Ferrari, slid off directly
          in front of Rosberg on lap 27 with a broken rear suspension link, Rosberg took over the fifth place he sought.
          Among the leaders, Alboreto began inching closer to Prost again, and Watson continued to close on both of
          them. Niki Lauda's McLaren retired on lap 54, while Alboreto had eliminated the gap to Prost, and gotten by
          him to take the lead in a Grand Prix for the first time. Prost's tires were picking up rubber and had
          developed a vibration. In four more laps, Watson had also caught and passed him, but he was having the same
          problem as Prost, and so could make no progress on Alboreto.
          Alboreto cruised to a comfortable victory, his first ever and the first for Tyrrell in four years</p>
