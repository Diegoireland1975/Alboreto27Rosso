            Alboreto is just that:
          </p>
          <p>The extraordinary story
            of a boy who, like so many others, followed the races
            behind the metal fences of the Monza racetrack,
            and in a few years he became the final Italian driver to claim victory in a Grand Prix behind the wheel of a
            Ferrari</p>
          <p>
            Neither rich, nor daddy's boy, he did not belong to a
            generation of "kart drivers".</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>Born in Milan on December 23, 1956, he made his debut in
            world of racing in 1976 at the wheel of a
            “Formula Monza” of Scuderia Salvati. Hungry for
            victory, animated by a "young rage", he showcased himself as an authentic aggressive driver—much like his
            idol, the legendary Ronnie Peterson. It was from Peterson that he adopted the blue and yellow colors of his
            helmet.</p>
          <p>Two years later, in "Formula Italia," his victory in Magione opened the doors of Formula 3, which was
            no small feat in the late seventies. Already a vice-champion in his first year, he claimed the top spot in
            1980. During the same year, he was also recruited by Lancia for the endurance championship, joining the
            ranks of the already renowned drivers Patrese, Cheever, and Rohrl.</p>

      <div class="py-1 text">
        <p>In 1981, he would achieve gratifications on multiple fronts: In F2 with Minardi. he imposed himself at Misano
          against the official March and Spirit
          teams, achieving the
          only triumph in the history of the Faenza stable. In addition to new victories with the Lancia LMP1, thanks to
          the 'mediation' of some friends, came the call from Ken Tyrrell.</p>
        <p>
          The great talent scout of the Formula 1 Circus offered him a seat for the San Marino GP. He exploited the
          opportunity well, and his apprenticeship in F1 continued for the rest of the championship and the following
          year. Still driving for the Tyrrell team, the breakthrough came with the incredible victory in Las Vegas in
          the last race of the season.

        <div class="text">
          <p> Enzo Ferrari put aside his proverbial xenophilia and began to keep an eye on him. In 1983, he gave another
            victory to Tyrrell and the glorious Ford Cosworth, marking the last victory in their history on the Detroit
            street circuit. By this time, he had become one of the best drivers in the world."</p>
          <p>At the end of the season, a McLaren offer was on the table. However, when the call from Enzo Ferrari came
            in
            October of that year, Michele didn't hesitate: from 1984 onwards, he would be a Ferrari driver alongside
            Renè
            Arnoux. An Italian driver had been absent from the Ferrari team for eleven years, dating back to the distant
            era of Arturo Merzario.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="text py-1">
        <p>
          Just like three years prior with that race at Imola, Alboreto seized the opportunity once again. He declared
          that "racing for the Cavallino Rampante (Ferrari's symbol) is an opportunity to understand if you will ever be
          able to become a champion or remain only a good driver."</p>
        <p>
          In that year, another important event took place in his life his marriage to Nadia, his lifelong love. Their
          relationship had blossomed during his youth on the outskirts of Rozzano, a place he never forgot. He remained
          tied to his childhood friends and the memories of that tim

      <div class="py-1 flex">
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            In 1984 the McLarens of Lauda and Prost were superior but Michele got his first historic victory at Zolder
            in red and then gives the "home" fans a nice second place in Monza. The wait is for the following year and
            with the new 156/85 Ferrari takes off at the start of the season.</p>
          <p>
            After excellent placements, Alboreto wins in Canada but his greatest triumph is at the Nurburgring, where he
            leaps to the top of the World Championship and his world ambitions are
            concrete. An incredible series of failures and breakages, however, will deliver the title to Prost and
            (again)
            to McLaren, leaving him the place of honor and a bitter taste in the mouth.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>It's a missed opportunity; an Italian World Champion has been absent since the heroic era of another
            Milanese driver, Alberto Ascari. After a disappointing 1986 season, Ferrari embarked on a new technical
            journey with John Barnard at the helm.
            Challenging times commenced for both Barnard and Michele Alboreto. Meanwhile, Alboreto's new teammate, the
            Austrian driver Gerhard Berger, achieved victories in Japan and Australia during the 1987 season.</p>
          <p>
            In 1988, McLaren's dominance was almost unbroken, except for a remarkable exception at Monza. Only a month
            had passed since Enzo Ferrari's passing, and the Ferrari team managed to achieve a remarkable double victory
            filled with emotion and significance on the Brianza circuit, which hosts the Italian Grand Prix.

          <p>Alboreto secured the second position on the podium, surrounded by a sea of red flags, as he bid farewell to
            the Ferrari team and the Cavallino Rampante (Ferrari's symbol).
            Shortly before his passing, Enzo Ferrari had called Alboreto to Maranello. With Nigel Mansell set to join
            the
            team the following year, the decision was still in the hands of the influential Ferrari Chief. Despite the
            possibility of contract renewal, Alboreto chose to express gratitude for the immense trust placed in him and
            decided to move on.</p>
          <p>
            For the 1989 season, without a place at Williams, Alboreto returned to where his Formula One journey began:
            the blue Tyrrell 017. Despite limited resources and lacking major sponsors, he achieved an incredible
            third-place finish in Mexico, marking his final podium appearance in the sport.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="text">

        <p>
          Amid mid-season contractual issues, Alboreto's association with Tyrrell came to an end. He then moved on to
          the modest Larrousse team, followed by stints at Footwork (achieving some respectable results in 1992) and
          the
          Scuderia Italia (a challenging year). In 1994, he reunited with his old team Minardi. Tragically, amidst the
          events of Imola, he comprehended that Ayrton Senna's fatal accident would profoundly transform the sport's
          atmosphere.</p>
        <p>
          Alboreto attained a splendid sixth place in Monaco, his final race that garnered a point, culminating his
          illustrious and extensive Formula One career spanning 215 Grands Prix and 5 victories. Following his
          retirement from the racing scene, a new chapter of life awaited him.
