            Alboreto is just that:
          </p>
          <p>The extraordinary story
            of a boy who, like so many others, followed the races
            behind the metal fences of the Monza racetrack,
            and in a few years he became the final Italian driver to claim victory in a Grand Prix behind the wheel of a
            Ferrari</p>
          <p>
            Neither rich, nor daddy's boy, he did not belong
            generation of "kart drivers".</p>

          <p>Born in Milan on December 23, 1956, he made his debut in
            world of racing in 1976 at the wheel of a
            “Formula Monza” of Scuderia Salvati. Hungry for
            victory, animated by a "young rage", he showcased himself as an authentic aggressive driver—much like his
            idol, the legendary Ronnie Peterson. It was from Peterson that he adopted the blue and yellow colors of his
            helmet.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <p>Two years later, in "Formula Italia," his victory in Magione opened the doors of Formula 3, which was
          no small feat in the late seventies. Already a vice-champion in his first year, he claimed the top spot in
          1980. During the same year, he was also recruited by Lancia for the endurance championship, joining the
          ranks of the already renowned drivers Patrese, Cheever, and Rohrl. In 1981, he would achieve gratifications
          on multiple fronts:
        </p>
        <p>In F2 with Minardi. he imposed himself at Misano against the official March and Spirit teams, achieving the
          only triumph in the history of the Faenza stable. In addition to new victories with the Lancia LMP1, thanks to
          the 'mediation' of some friends, came the call from Ken Tyrrell.</p>
        <p>
          The great talent scout of the Formula 1 Circus offered him a seat for the San Marino GP. He exploited the
          opportunity well, and his apprenticeship in F1 continued for the rest of the championship and the following
          year. Still driving for the Tyrrell team, the breakthrough came with the incredible victory in Las Vegas in
          the last race of the season.
          Enzo Ferrari put aside his proverbial xenophilia and began to keep an eye on him. In 1983, he gave another
          victory to Tyrrell and the glorious Ford Cosworth, marking the last victory in their history on the Detroit
          street circuit. By this time, he had become one of the best drivers in the world."
        </p>
        <p>At the end of the season, a McLaren offer was on the table. However, when the call from Enzo Ferrari came in
          October of that year, Michele didn't hesitate: from 1984 onwards, he would be a Ferrari driver alongside Renè
          Arnoux. An Italian driver had been absent from the Ferrari team for eleven years, dating back to the distant
          era of Arturo Merzario.</p>
        <p>
          Just like three years prior with that race at Imola, Alboreto seized the opportunity once again. He declared
          that "racing for the Cavallino Rampante (Ferrari's symbol) is an opportunity to understand if you will ever be
          able to become a champion or remain only a good rider."</p>
        <p>
          In that year, another important event took place in his life his marriage to Nadia, his lifelong love. Their
          relationship had blossomed during his youth on the outskirts of Rozzano, a place he never forgot. He remained
          tied to his childhood friends and the memories of that tim
        </p>
        <p>These were difficult years in Ferrari during which Alboreto
          matures, becomes a great conscious professional
          of his own means, able with his indications and stubbornness to compact an often torn team
          from deadly infighting, soon discovering how it is more difficult to learn to lose than to win.
          In 1984 the McLarens of Lauda and Prost were superior but Michele got his first historic victory at Zolder
          in red and then gives the "home" fans a nice second place in Monza. The wait is for the following year and
          with the new 156/85 Ferrari takes off at the start of the season.</p>
        <p>
          After excellent placements, Alboreto wins in Canada but his greatest triumph is at the Nurburgring, where he
          leaps to the top of the World Championship and his world ambitions are
          concrete. An incredible series of failures and breakages, however, will deliver the title to Prost and (again)
          to McLaren, leaving him the place of honor and a bitter taste in the mouth.</p>

        "He is a young man who drives so well, with few errors" - "He is fast,

        have argued that it is among the top six in Formula 1 and that with a
        competitive car it will certainly not waste the chance to become a
