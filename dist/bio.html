          <p>The extraordinary story
            of a boy who, like so many others, followed the races
            behind the metal fences of the Monza racetrack,
            and in a few years he became the final Italian driver to claim victory in a Grand Prix behind the wheel of a
            Ferrari</p>

            Neither rich, nor daddy's boy, he did not belong

          <p>Born in Milan on December 23, 1956, he made his debut in
            world of racing in 1976 at the wheel of a
            “Formula Monza” of Scuderia Salvati. Hungry for
            victory, animated by a "young rage", he showcased himself as an authentic aggressive driver—much like his
            idol, the legendary Ronnie Peterson. It was from Peterson that he adopted the blue and yellow colors of his
            helmet.</p>

        <p>Two years later, in "Formula Italia," his victory in Magione swung open the doors of Formula 3, which was
          no small feat in the late seventies. Already a vice-champion in his first year, he claimed the top spot in
          1980. During the same year, he was also recruited by Lancia for the endurance championship, joining the
          ranks of the already renowned drivers Patrese, Cheever, and Rohrl. In 1981, he would achieve gratifications
